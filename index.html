            <h3>Front-end Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I am currently a final-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Engineering in National
                University, Bangladesh. I am a sincere and diligent person who always strives to give my best in
                everything.
                I am interested in exploring new ideas, concepts and innovations
                regarding technology and continually looking for ways to improve my programming knowledge and coding
                skills.

            <h3>Become a Full-stack Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Full-stack web developers are developers who work with both the front-end and the back-end of a website.
                They’re familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one or more back-end languages. Hence the term “full
                stack”—they’ve got all the web development skills to build sites from start to finish. The individual
                needs to be knowledgeable in all the technologies involved and should be able to understand the
                processes happening within the entire application. Full-stack developer has become one of the most
                sought-after positions in the technology domain. I want to work hard and achieve my dream of becoming a
                full-stack web developer.</p>
